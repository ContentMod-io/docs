## Projects and Billing Overview

With ContentMod, users have the flexibility to create and manage multiple projects independently. Each project operates in its own sandboxed environment with dedicated resources, quotas, and billing. This structure provides a seamless way to organize and optimize your content moderation workflows.

### Key Highlights:

1. **Independent Projects**:

   - Each user can create multiple projects tailored to different applications or use cases.
   - Projects are isolated, ensuring no overlap in quotas or configurations.

2. **Dedicated Quotas**:

   - Each project comes with its own quota for tokens, API calls, or other resources.
   - Quotas can be monitored and adjusted individually to suit your requirements.

3. **Separate Billing**:

   - Projects are billed separately, offering clear and transparent cost tracking.
   - Receive detailed invoices for each project, making it easy to manage budgets for multiple initiatives.

4. **Flexible Management**:
   - Easily create, update, or delete projects through the user-friendly dashboard or API.
   - Configure specific rules, moderation settings, and limits for each project as needed.

### Example Use Case:

Suppose you're running a digital agency with multiple clients:

- Create a separate project for each client.
- Allocate specific token quotas based on the client's subscription tier.
- Receive individual billing statements for clear client cost reconciliation.

This approach ensures precise resource allocation and expense management, empowering you to focus on delivering value while we handle the complexity.

### Getting Started

- **Step 1**: Log in to your account and navigate to the **Projects** section.
- **Step 2**: Click **Create New Project** and define its settings.
- **Step 3**: Track usage and billing from the dashboard.

With ContentMod, managing multiple projects has never been easier. Organize smarter, bill clearer, and scale faster!
